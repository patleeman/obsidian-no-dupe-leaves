# Obsidian "No Dupe Leaves" plugin

> Let's say I have 2 open notes, _A_ and _B_.  
> _A_ has a link to _B_.  
> If I click on `[[B]]` from _A_, Obsidian will re-open _B_. Is there a way to just show the note if it's already open?

Well, there it is.

**!! This plugin is a quick hack for something that should be a feature !!**

It was made in 20 minutes, it's probably buggy, but it looks like it works.
